# Machine-learning

1.Run "obj_model" to build a model.\\
2.Run "object detection" to perform object detection with YOLOv3 algorithm.\\
3.Run "object_zebra" to plot the results from the algorithm.\\
4.Any random images need to be provided in "object detection" and "object_zebra".\\
5.Specific information and reports is written in the paper "CAP6610 final report.\\
